# I'm Tony, and this is my blog.

I have adapted an old project that you can reach [here](https://github.com/mx3m/hikari-for-jekyll). 

## I will be utilizing this blog for

* Documenting my experiences with various tools - not much in this realm escapes my interest
* Voicing my opinion regarding ongoing events in tech and elsewhere (everything is tech, right?)
* Sharing art! I love to shoot & edit film as well as try my hand at graphic design (user interfaces, logos, you name it)

Expect this site to change a lot, as I'm still figuring out what I like and what I don't like about how it's set up. 

More to come on my experience using Jekyll to blog -  being a designer and developer that has used every CMS under the sun, I am sure to have at least two cents to spare.

I hope I haven't wasted too much of your precious time, and if you're even a pinch as excited as I am to start blogging - cheers!
